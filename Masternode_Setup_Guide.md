Select the Masternode Address and click `Copy Address`. Paste the address in a text editor  

Click `New Address` again and enter a label for your Reward Address (e.g. Rewards1) and click `OK` *(do not check `Stealth Address`)*  

Select the Reward Address and click `Copy Address`. Paste the address in a text editor

Go to the `Send` tab

*Use "Coin Control" to select your collateral. If Coin Control is not visible, enable by navigating to menu >Options>Display*

Paste the address on the `Pay To` box and enter 5 in the `Amount` box  

*Note : You must be sent exactly 5 SMTN in a single transaction*  

Click `Send` *(do not check `Darksend`)*

### 3. Setup VPS   
Login to your VPS ([Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7684542) or [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/917baa6de4c8)) using your SSH client
Deploy a new instance *(1GB RAM  VPS Recommended)*

Login to your instance using your SSH Client

#### 3-1. Installation  

Paste the applicable command below into your terminal to run the automated masternode installation script.
*these scripts automatically install the daemon and a bootstrap; therefore, they will take some time to run. Please be patient.*

#### Linux Dependencies
apt-get install net-tools curl -y

Ubuntu 16.04 VPS:

Install dos2unix:
```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix -y

```
Run the setup commands:

```
wget -q https://github.com/safeminecoin/safemasternode/releases/download/1.0/masternode1604.sh
chmod +x masternode1604.sh
dos2unix masternode1804.sh
bash masternode1604.sh

```  

Ubuntu 18.04 VPS:

Install dos2unix:
```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix -y

```
Run the setup commands:

```
wget -q https://github.com/safeminecoin/safemasternode/releases/download/1.0/masternode1804.sh
chmod +x masternode1804.sh
dos2unix masternode1804.sh
bash masternode1804.sh

```  
Paste your masternode genkey when prompted

#### VPS Masternode Troubleshooting

*Get the status code to identify issues:'./safemasternoded masternode status'* 

The "status" of your masternode will be one of the following:

1 = Your masternode has not been processed by the network yet. Please wait.

2 = Your masternode is active and synced to the network.

3 = Your masternode is inactive.

4 = Your masternode has stopped.

5 = Your masternode seed transaction hasn't reached the minimum of 16 confirmations.

6 = Your masternode port is closed.

7 = Your masternode port is open.

8 = Your masternode is syncing to the network.

9 = Your masternode is remotely enabled and active.

### 4. Setup local wallet part 2 of 2  

After 10 confirmations type `masternode outputs` in the `Debug window` in your wallet

Copy the TxHash and output index number and paste it into your text editor

*the "Output Index" number is after the collateral tx and is either a "1" or "0"*
___
### 5. Create the Masternode  
Go to the `Masternodes` tab

Click the `Create...` button

Fill in the form using the instructions provided by the wallet. Use the information recorded in your text editor from previous steps.

Note: Be sure to add :32821 to the end of the VPS ip in the "Address" field!

Click `OK`  

Click `Update`  

Select your masternode
Click `Start`  

*Note: If you receive an error such as "Could not allocate VIN", unlock your wallet and click `Start` again.*
*If the error reoccurs then you may need to reinstall your VPS, remove the masternode (see below) from your masternode.conf file, and begin the setup from the beginning*

The above steps will create a 'masternode.conf' file in your %appdata% folder (windows).
Masternodes can be removed by editing or deleting file. Your collateral will reappear after you restart your wallet.

You may need to wait a few hours or even a day to receive rewards depending on the number of masternodes on the network.

### 6. Checking masternode status  
Click `Update` periodically to ensure your masternodes are running

After 30 minutes, your masternode `Active(secs)` will be reflected in the safemasternode subtab

### Thank you for running a safemasternode Masternode!
